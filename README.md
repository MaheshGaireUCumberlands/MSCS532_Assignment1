# MSCS532 Assignment 1 â€” Insertion Sort (Monotonically Decreasing Order)

## ðŸ“˜ Overview
This repository contains my implementation of the **Insertion Sort algorithm** that sorts an array in **monotonically decreasing (descending) order**.  
The assignment demonstrates understanding of algorithm design principles, Python programming, and version control using Git and GitHub.

## ðŸ§© Problem Description
Insertion Sort is a simple and intuitive comparison-based sorting algorithm.  
Traditionally, it arranges elements in **increasing order**, but for this assignment, it has been adapted to sort data in **decreasing order**.

The algorithm works as follows:
1. Start from the second element in the list.
2. Compare it with elements before it and **shift smaller elements to the right**.
3. Insert the current element into its correct position.
4. Repeat until the entire list is sorted.
